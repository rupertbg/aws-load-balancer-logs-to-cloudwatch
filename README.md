# AWS Load Balancer S3 Logs to CloudWatch Logs
![unit tests](https://github.com/rupertbg/aws-load-balancer-logs-to-cloudwatch/actions/workflows/tests.yml/badge.svg?branch=master)

Latest release [available on ECR Public](https://gallery.ecr.aws/metaphor/awslb2cwlogs):

- `public.ecr.aws/metaphor/awslb2cwlogs:arm64-latest`
- `public.ecr.aws/metaphor/awslb2cwlogs:amd64-latest`


Stream AWS Load Balancer Logs that are delivered to S3 into CloudWatch Logs for use with features like CloudWatch Logs Insights.

Logs are loaded from S3 as they are created using an [S3 Event Notification](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/with-s3.html), which can be optionally buffered via an SQS Queue. The logs are then parsed into JSON and shipped to Cloudwatch Logs.

# Usage
`cfn/example.yml` shows how to deploy the Lambda alongside Classic, Application or Network Load Balancers. Use this template as a starting point for your deployment.

## ECR Public
To access the public ECR image directly in a Lambda you will either need to create a [pull through cache](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECR/latest/userguide/pull-through-cache.html) for ECR Public, or use the public image URI as the `FROM` directive in your own private dockerfile.

If you are using a pull through cache, use the following format to reference the image in your Lambda Function, assuming your ECR Public pull through cache was prefixed "ecr-public".

`${AWS::AccountId}.dkr.ecr.${AWS::Region}.amazonaws.com/ecr-public/metaphor/awslb2cwlogs:arm64-latest`

## Environment Variables
The Lambda takes the following environment variables:
  - `LOG_GROUP_NAME`: The name of the Log Group to ship to
  - `LOAD_BALANCER_TYPE`: The load balancer type. Must be `classic`, `application` or `network`
  - `PLAINTEXT_LOGS`: If set to anything will ship the plaintext log line instead of parsing it to JSON

## Identity & Access Management
The Lambda requires access similar to the following IAM Policy:

```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17T00:00:00.000Z",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": "logs:DescribeLogGroups",
      "Resource": "*"
    },
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [
        "logs:DescribeLogStreams",
        "logs:CreateLogStream",
        "logs:PutLogEvents"
      ],
      "Resource": "arn:*:logs:*:REPLACE_WITH_AWS_ACCOUNT_ID:log-group:REPLACE_WITH_LOG_GROUP_NAME"
    },
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": "s3:GetObject",
      "Resource": "arn:*:s3:::REPLACE_WITH_LOG_BUCKET_NAME/*"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Buffering S3 events with an SQS Queue
The Lambda supports invocation via S3 events or SQS events. To use with SQS you will need a Queue, Queue Policy and Event Source similar to the following Cloudformation snippet:

```yaml
LogDeliveryQueue:
  Type: AWS::SQS::Queue
  DeletionPolicy: Delete
  UpdateReplacePolicy: Delete
  Properties:
    QueueName: !Sub ${AWS::StackName}-logs
    VisibilityTimeout: 180
    MessageRetentionPeriod: 345600

SQSQueuePolicy:
  Type: AWS::SQS::QueuePolicy
  Properties:
    Queues:
      - !Ref LogDeliveryQueue
    PolicyDocument:
      Version: 2012-10-17
      Statement:
        - Effect: Allow
          Principal:
            AWS: "*"
          Action: sqs:SendMessage
          Resource: "*"
          Condition:
            ArnLike:
              aws:SourceArn: !Sub arn:${AWS::Partition}:s3:::${AWS::AccountId}-${AWS::StackName}

LoggingSQSEventSource:
  Type: AWS::Lambda::EventSourceMapping
  Properties:
    BatchSize: 10
    Enabled: true
    EventSourceArn: !GetAtt LogDeliveryQueue.Arn
    FunctionName: !Ref LoadBalancerLogsToCloudWatchLambda
    ScalingConfig:
      MaximumConcurrency: 2
    FunctionResponseTypes:
      - ReportBatchItemFailures
```
